        <h1>The TRX workout</h1>
        <img src="assets/trx.jpg">
        <p class="intro">Do not be scared of this piece of equipment, be very excited! If you are looking for something different, follow this program for the next 4 weeks. The TRX is a suspension training system, which will fire up muscles you did not know existed.</p>
        <p>This system uses your natural body weight as a resistance, meaning it is quick and easy to increase or decrease the workload.</p>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <p>Complete the number of reps associated with the exercise, rest for 30 seconds and complete a second set.</p>
        <p>If you have any questions regarding the setup of the TRX it is important you see a member of the personal training team.</p>
        <p>Ensure you complete a thorough warmup before you start this workout, and a thorough warm down and full body stretch afterwards.</p>
