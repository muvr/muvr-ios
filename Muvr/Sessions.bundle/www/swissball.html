        <p class="intro">We bet you have seen these, you've probably even sat on one ... maybe fallen off?!</p>
        <p>These balls are great pieces of equipment and should be tremendous amount of fun. They are designed to increase your balance, coordination whilst intensely targeting the deep core muscles.</p>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <p>For the swissball exercises, begin with 2 sets of 15 and have 30 seconds rest between exercises.</p>
        <p>For the plank position perform 2 sets of 30 seconds.</p>
        <p>For the exercises with dumbbells, ensure the weight is heavy enough to only just complete the rep range.</p>
