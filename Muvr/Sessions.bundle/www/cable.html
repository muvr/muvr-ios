        <h1>The cable workout</h1>
        <img src="assets/cable.jpg">
        <p class="intro">The 8-stack multi station and functional trainer are fantastic pieces of kit that can act as a one stop shop for an entire body workout!</p>
        <p class="intro">They combine cables with different attachments to provide an endless list of exercises!</p>
        <p>This program will help you develop a strong, toned core. You may only think you are working your arms, but it is the body positioning that really makes your abs work too.</p>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <p>Begin with 2 sets of 12 and have a 30 seconds rest between exercises. If this is easy, then increase the weight and shorten the rest period to 15 seconds.</p>
        <p>Ensure you complete a thorough warmup before you start this workout, and a thorough warm down and full body stretch afterwards.</p>
