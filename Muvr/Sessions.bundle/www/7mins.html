    <img src="assets/7-min.png">
    <p class="intro">The 7 minutes workout is based on high intensity circuit training and has been proved the most "safe, effective and efficient" way to improve your muscles and health.</p>
    <p class="intro">It only takes about 7 minutes, which consists of 13 exercises. Each exercise is to be taken 30 seconds with 10 seconds intervals between exercises. All you need is a chair and a wall.</p>
    <p>Repeat 2-3 circuits according to your time.</p>
    <p>The 7 minutes workout is for the time-constrained people to improve physical energy in very short time. It can be done anywhere</p>
    <p>The program trains the whole body muscle with extremely intense activities by using the resistance of the body weight. And it really works: "maximum results with minimal investment".
    <h2>The benefits</h2>
    <p>The 7 minutes workout is a fast and efficient way to lose weight and fat because the resistance training contributes significantly to the fat burned during a workout.</p>
    <p>High intensity circuit training (HICT) may be an extremely effective and efficient means to increase an individual's V.BO2max, which can improve cardiopulmonary health.</p>
    <h2>Exercise order</h2>
    <p>You should follow the 7 minutes HICT order, which can train muscle groups during the consecutive exercises by alternating rest and exercise.</p>
    <h2>Individual exercise time</h2>
    <p>30 seconds is sufficient for each exercise to be taken 12-15 times.</p>
    <h2>Total exercise time</h2>
    <p>It is suggested that you repeat 2-3 circuits, that is at least 20 minutes per session</p>
