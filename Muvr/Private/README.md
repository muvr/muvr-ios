This directory should contain ``Aws.swift`` file, which defines the AWS access key and access key secret.

```swift
struct AwsCredentials {

    static let accessKey = "..."
    static let secretKey = "..."

}
```

All sources (*.swift) are .gitignored here, so you will need to have *local* copy of this file. The best
way to get it is on Flowdock.
